# Migrate Extension Workshop

**Mentor:** Bob Silverberg

**Email:** bsilverberg@mozilla.com

## Project Description

The static website extension workshop was built out using Jekyll, over time the build times for this project 
have escalated so we'd like to figure out ways to improve the performance. 

This could be done in several ways:

* Update jekyll and tune it
* Move to a new static site generator that minimizes the changes (e.g. 11ty) 
* Re-write the site for a completely new static site generate (e.g. Hugo)

## Skills Required

- Experience with Git and GitHub
- Familiarity with the Jekyll, JS and build processes.
- Familiarity with front-end web development (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- An inquring mind and good communication skills as interaction with the mentor and members of the team will be asynchronous
- Ability to work remotely

## Project Details

Here are some of the goals.

* The site will build very fast to aid local development
* The code site functionality should stay the same
* If the process for making new documentation can be made smoother that would be welcomed.
