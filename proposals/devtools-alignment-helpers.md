# DevTools: CSS Alignment Helpers

**Mentors:** Gabriel Luong, Razvan Caliman

**Email:** gl@mozilla.com, rcaliman@mozilla.com

## Project Description

There are many CSS properties and values to do alignment in the various CSS layout modules, like Flexbox and Grid. This can be overwhelming. It would help developers to have previews that illustrate the effect of alignment properties and values right in the autocomplete menu.

**UI mock-ups**

## Project Details

In recent years, the Firefox Developer Tools team have been creating new CSS layout-related tools for Flexbox and CSS grids. In addition, we have also extended the CSS autocomplete to present more informations regarding CSS variables which displays the value of a CSS variable and an additional color swatch if the value is a color value.

In this project, we are looking to continue extending the usefulness of the CSS autocomplete by displaying visual indicators for alignment properties. As well as improving the Flexbox and CSS Grid inspector with the displaying the alignment preview icons in the Layout panel.

This project will give you the opportunity to understand the frontend development of Firefox Developer Tools written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and utilizes React and Redux.

Some of the tasks for this project can be broken out into the following:
* Add alignment preview icons in the CSS autocomplete menu
* Orient the alignment preview icons according to their flex-direction
* Add alignment preview icons in the Layout panel

## Additional Information

* Work will need to be submitted for code review on [Mozilla’s Phabricator](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Phabricator) instance.

* Communication will happen through the [Firefox DevTools’ Slack](https://devtools-html-slack.herokuapp.com/).

* [Firefox Developer Tools Community & Documentation](http://firefox-dev.tools/)
