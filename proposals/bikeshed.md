## Project Description

A faithful rewrite of [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed), a tool used for generating many standards, in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

## Skills Required

Experience with

* Git/GitHub
* Rust
* Python

would be ideal.

## Project Details

The goal of the project is to have a faithful rewrite of [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed), written in Python, in Rust, with an eye on performance and ongoing maintenance. Ideally it would be fast enough to process ~5MiB inputs (i.e., the HTML Standard source code) relatively quickly.
